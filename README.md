# axmcp

**Drive macOS apps the way a human does — through the Accessibility API, from an MCP client.**

`axmcp` is a macOS automation toolkit built around three MCP servers and matching CLIs. It lets an LLM (or a shell script) inspect and operate native apps, Xcode projects, and iOS simulators with the same primitives Apple's own assistive technologies use.

| Server | What it drives | Shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cmd/axmcp` | Any running macOS app via AX tree, OCR, pointer, keyboard, windows | Open primitive surface |
| `cmd/xcmcp` | Xcode, simulators, physical devices, previews, App Store Connect | Toolset-gated, ~40 tools on demand |
| `cmd/computer-use-mcp` | Codex Computer Use contract on top of axmcp primitives | Exactly the 9-tool spec, session-stateful |

If you want an LLM to click through a real app: `axmcp`. If you want it to build, test, boot a simulator, or add an Xcode target via the File > New UI: `xcmcp`. If you need a drop-in for the Codex Computer Use tool contract: `computer-use-mcp`.

## Why this exists

- **Accessibility-first, not screenshot-first.** Pointer actions target AX elements by role and title, so an LLM can say "click the Build button" and get the actual button — not the pixel that looked right a moment ago.
- **OCR and screenshots are the fallback, not the plan.** `ax_ocr`, `ax_ocr_diff`, and `ax_ocr_click` exist for Electron apps, custom canvases, and partially inaccessible UI. They ride on top of the AX flow, not around it.
- **The hard Xcode moves are scripted.** `xcode_add_target` drives the File > New > Target wizard end-to-end, including the platform tab, template picker, and "Embed in Application" popup, then verifies the new scheme landed on disk.
- **One repo, three audiences.** The primitive surface (`axmcp`) is for open exploration; the Codex contract (`computer-use-mcp`) is for drop-in replacement; the Xcode surface (`xcmcp`) is the IDE-adjacent tool belt. They share one set of internal packages so behavior stays consistent.

## Requirements

- macOS with Xcode installed.
- Command Line Tools available through `xcrun`.
- Go 1.26 or newer to build from source.
- Accessibility permission for commands that drive the UI: `axmcp`, `ax`, `xcmcp`, `xc`, `computer-use-mcp`.
- A booted simulator or connected device for simulator and device workflows.

## Install

Build the commands you need:

```sh
go install ./cmd/xcmcp ./cmd/xc ./cmd/ax ./cmd/axmcp ./cmd/ascript ./cmd/ascriptmcp ./cmd/computer-use-mcp
```

Or build the whole module:

```sh
go build ./...
```

## Granting Accessibility permission

macOS gates every pointer, keystroke, and AX tree read behind explicit user consent. The first time a binary issues an AX call, macOS refuses and logs the binary as a candidate in **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**. Toggle the entry on.

If an action silently no-ops or returns "not permitted," this is usually the cause. The `cmd/tcc-harness` binary exists specifically to probe the TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) state without mutating anything, so you can diagnose before you automate.

## Quick Start

**Drive any running app:**

```sh
axmcp
```

Exposes `ax_apps`, `ax_tree`, `ax_find`, `ax_focus`, `ax_click`, `ax_drag`, `ax_type`, `ax_menu`, `ax_set_value`, `ax_perform_action`, `ax_keystroke`, `ax_zoom`, `ax_pinch`, `ax_screenshot`, `ax_ocr`, `ax_ocr_diff`, `ax_action_screenshot`, `ax_ocr_action_diff`, `ax_ocr_click`, `ax_ocr_hover`, plus window-scoped variants (`ax_window_*`).

**Work with Xcode and simulators:**

```sh
xcmcp
```

Always-on: `discover_projects`, `list_schemes`, `show_build_settings`, `build`, `test`, `list_simulators`, `boot_simulator`, `shutdown_simulator`, `xcode_add_target`, `list_toolsets`, `enable_toolset`. The Xcode bridge toolset (IDE-facing tools from `xcrun mcpbridge`) is enabled by default.

Optional toolsets are loaded on demand:

```sh
xcmcp --enable-ui-tools --enable-device-tools --enable-ios-tools
```

Or all at once:

```sh
xcmcp --enable-all
```

**Drop-in Codex Computer Use contract:**

```sh
computer-use-mcp
```

Exposes exactly `list_apps`, `get_app_state`, `click`, `perform_secondary_action`, `set_value`, `scroll`, `drag`, `press_key`, `type_text`. Call `get_app_state` once per turn, then act against `element_index` strings from the snapshot.

## MCP client configuration

Register one or all three servers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "axmcp": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/axmcp"
    },
    "xcmcp": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/xcmcp",
      "args": ["--enable-ui-tools", "--enable-device-tools", "--enable-ios-tools"]
    },
    "computer-use-mcp": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/computer-use-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Within a session, use `list_toolsets` and `enable_toolset` to turn optional `xcmcp` toolsets on and off dynamically.

## Commands

### `axmcp`

`axmcp` is the open Accessibility surface. It targets running macOS applications directly through the Accessibility API, with OCR and screenshot fallbacks for custom-drawn or partially inaccessible UIs.

Primitive tools cover element discovery, pointer and keyboard input, window manipulation, screenshots, and OCR-driven interactions.

### `computer-use-mcp`

`computer-use-mcp` is the stateful, session-oriented compatibility server. It holds the narrow Codex Computer Use tool contract on top of the same accessibility and screenshot primitives.

It is tools-only — no MCP resources, no resource templates. The tool surface is app-scoped: call `get_app_state` first, then pass returned `element_index` strings to the action tools.

### `xcmcp`

`xcmcp` serves tools and resources over stdio.

Optional toolsets:

- `app`: app lifecycle, install, uninstall, logs, and app listing
- `ui`: UI tree, tap, inspect, query, screenshot, and wait
- `device`: simulator orientation, privacy, location, appearance, and screenshots
- `ios`: direct CoreSimulator-based accessibility tree and hit-testing
- `simulator_extras`: open URL, add media, and app container lookup
- `physical_device`: connected device inspection and app lifecycle actions
- `video`: simulator recording
- `crash`: crash report listing and reading
- `filesystem`: file access helpers
- `dependency`: Swift Package Manager helpers
- `asc`: App Store Connect and `altool` helpers

### `xc`

`xc` exposes the same building blocks as a direct CLI:

```sh
xc sims list
xc build --scheme MyApp
xc test --scheme MyApp
xc app launch com.example.MyApp --udid booted
xc ui tree --bundle-id com.apple.finder
xc ios tree --udid booted
xc xcode add-target --template "Widget Extension" --product MyWidget --platform iOS
```

### `ax`

`ax` is the direct CLI companion to `axmcp`:

```sh
ax apps
ax tree com.apple.finder
ax find com.apple.dt.Xcode --role AXButton --title Build
```

### `ascript` and `ascriptmcp`

These commands inspect scriptable applications and run AppleScript-backed operations:

```sh
ascript list /Applications/Xcode.app
ascript classes /Applications/Finder.app
ascript script /Applications/Finder.app activate
```

## Resources

`xcmcp` registers these MCP resources by default:

- `xcmcp://project`
- `xcmcp://simulators`
- `xcmcp://apps`
- `xcmcp://apps/{bundle_id}/tree`
- `xcmcp://apps/{bundle_id}/logs`

## Internal layout

This module is command-first. Reusable helpers live under `internal/` and are not intended as a public import surface.

- `internal/project`: discover Xcode projects, inspect schemes and build settings
- `internal/xcodebuild`: build and test wrappers
- `internal/xcodewizard`: File > New > Target wizard automation, shared by `xc` and `xcmcp`
- `internal/simctl`: simulator management through `xcrun simctl`
- `internal/devicectl`: physical device management
- `internal/ui`: macOS Accessibility access and UI screenshots
- `internal/screen`: screen capture helpers
- `internal/ghostcursor`: animated cursor overlay for demonstration and recording
- `internal/computeruse`: shared primitives behind `computer-use-mcp` (app state, input, coords, policy, session, approval, intervention)
- `internal/crash`: crash report listing and reading
- `internal/resources`: MCP resource registration
- `internal/sdef`: parser for AppleScript scripting definitions
- `internal/altool` and `internal/asc`: App Store Connect helpers
- `internal/tccprompt`: TCC permission prompt inspection (used by `cmd/tcc-harness`)

## Notes

- This repository targets macOS. Many packages use AppKit, Accessibility, or Apple developer tools directly.
- The repository name is `axmcp`, but it intentionally contains `axmcp`, `xcmcp`, and `computer-use-mcp`. They cover different layers of the same workflow surface.
- UI automation depends on macOS Accessibility permission and on the target app being reachable through the Accessibility tree.
- Some simulator and Xcode automation features rely on private or implementation-defined behavior and are best treated as developer tooling rather than a stable public protocol.
- The supported entry points are the commands in `cmd/`. Internal packages may change without notice.
